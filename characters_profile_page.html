                Demoman - The Explosive Cyclops
            </h1>
            
            <div class="left_profile">
                <img src="/character_profile_page_assets/battle_ready_demoman.png" alt="Demoman Battle Ready">
                <p>
                    Fancy making things go BOOM? Then meet the Demoman, the legendary one-eyed Scotsman whose answer to every problem involves copious amounts of explosives. Subtlety? Never heard of her! This is all about raining down grenades and setting sticky bomb traps that turn chokepoints into instant "nope zones" for the enemy team.
                    <br><br>
                    While direct hits can be tricky, the Demoman excels at area denial and dealing massive damage to packed groups. Lob those grenades and detonate those stickies to send foes flying! And for those moments when you crave a bit of close-quarters chaos, there's the wild and wonderful DemoKnight. Trade your sticky launcher for a melee weapon, charge into the fray, and deliver a devastating, albeit risky, smackdown.
                    <br><br>
                    Don't expect him on the front lines trading bullets. The Demoman is your artilleryman, launching explosive ordinance from a safer distance. Aim for objectives and around corners, and let the boom do the talking.
                    <br><br>
                    Known for his love of a good… beverage and his explosive personality, the Demoman also shares a spirited rivalry with the Engineer. Two engineers, two very different approaches to problem-solving (one builds, the other blows up).
                    <br><br>
                    So, if you like big explosions, area control, and the occasional headlong charge with a sword (and maybe a bit of digital "cheers" after a win), the Demoman is your explosive expert. Just keep a safe distance when the fuses are lit!

                Engineer - A Texan Tinkerer Who Solves Problems
            </h1>
            
            <div class="right_profile">
                <img src="/character_profile_page_assets/battle_ready_engineer.png" alt="Engineer Battle Ready">
                <p>
                    Got a problem? The Engineer's got a wrench, and with that wrench, he'll build a solution. Forget fancy talk and wild charges; this Texan is all about smarts and hard work. He's the backbone of any good team, setting up sturdy Sentry Guns that mow down anyone dumb enough to wander into their line of fire. Need to get somewhere fast? He can whip up a Teleporter quicker than you can say "yeehaw." And if you're lookin' for a bit of health and ammo, his trusty Dispenser will keep you topped off and ready for a fight.
                    <br><br>
                    The Engineer isn't about direct confrontation. He's about setting up a defensible position and letting his ingenious creations do the work. He's a master of area denial, turning strategic locations into heavily fortified nests. Keep that wrench handy, though! Maintaining and upgrading your buildings is key to survival. A well-placed and upgraded Sentry Gun can hold off an entire team, but a neglected one is just scrap metal waitin' to happen.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, some folks might try to get fancy with different wrenches and gadgets, leading to more offensive playstyles. But at his core, the Engineer is about smart defense and support. He's the quiet professional, more likely to be found calmly hammering away at his latest invention than charging into a firefight.
                    <br><br>
                    And while he might have a bit of a playful rivalry with that demolition-obsessed Scotsman ("That ain't engineering, that's just blowin' things up!"), deep down, he knows a good team needs a bit of both brains and… well, controlled explosions.

                Heavy - The Big Guy with the Big Gun
            </h1>

                <img src="/character_profile_page_assets/battle_ready_heavy.png" alt="Heavy Battle Ready">
                <p>
                    Meet the Heavy: part-time bullet dispenser, full-time Sasha enthusiast. This towering hulk of Russian muscle speaks softly and carries a minigun roughly the size of a small car. If you hear a deep laugh and the spinning of barrels, you've got about two seconds before you become a red mist.
                    <br><br>
                    Heavy is the tank of the team. He soaks up damage, mows down enemies like fresh grass, and pairs perfectly with a pocket Medic. He may be slow, but he's got enough firepower to turn hallways into shooting galleries and enemies into confetti.
                    <br><br>
                    He loves sandwiches, hugs, and speaking in oddly poetic metaphors about pain. He also loves Sasha. Don't touch Sasha. If you want to be the unstoppable wall of bullets your team rallies behind—and you don't mind moving at the speed of molasses with a gun—Heavy's your guy. Just remember: “Cry some more.”

                <p>
                    If you think doctors are supposed to follow ethics and not laugh maniacally while healing you with a device powered by questionable science, think again. Meet the Medic: German surgeon, battlefield miracle worker, and unlicensed experiment enthusiast.
                    <br><br>
                    He heals teammates, charges up the glorious Übercharge, and may or may not have removed his own Hippocratic Oath with a bonesaw. Don't ask where he got his medical degree—just be glad he's on your team.
                    <br><br>
                    Medic pairs best with Heavy, forming the ultimate power couple of pain and healing. But he's useful to everyone—especially when you're one foot in the grave and begging for a miracle.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether it's syringes, saws, or questionable birds, Medic delivers. If you enjoy multitasking, battlefield triage, and occasionally laughing like a mad scientist, grab your Medigun and start healing... or experimenting. Who's to say?

                <img src="/character_profile_page_assets/battle_ready_pyro.png" alt="Pyro Battle Ready">
                <p>
                    If you've ever looked at a flamethrower and thought, “Yes, but what if it was whimsical?”—say hello to Pyro. This flame-happy firestarter lives in a candy-colored world of rainbows and happiness... which tragically exists only in his own deeply terrifying imagination.
                    <br><br>
                    Pyro's gameplay is all about getting up close and personal. Burn enemies to a crisp, airblast projectiles (and people!) right back where they came from, and generally cause confusion, chaos, and fire safety violations. Every corner is a chance for ambush, and every enemy a future pile of ashes.
                    <br><br>
                    You won't know what Pyro's saying (they're completely unintelligible), but you'll know what they mean: flames. Lots of them. Ideal for players who like sneaking, burning, and hearing the screams of their foes (or are just really, really into fire). Whether hero or horror is up to interpretation. Either way, don't turn your back. Or do. Pyro likes that.

                <p>
                    Ever wish you could talk faster than you think and run faster than your regrets? Meet the Scout: Boston's fastest, sassiest, and most caffeinated trash-talker. Armed with a scattergun and a chip on his shoulder the size of New England, he's all about speed, smack talk, and smacking you upside the head with a baseball bat before you even knew he was there.
                    <br><br>
                    Scout excels at hit-and-run tactics and snagging objectives while the rest of the team is still tying their shoes. He's a pain to hit, a pain to fight, and a pain to listen to—unless you're into high-pitched insults and stories about how awesome he is. Spoiler: he thinks he's very awesome.
                    <br><br>
                    Ideal for players who like to zip around the map, make a mess, and get out before the enemy can say “Did anyone see that little—” BANG.
                    <br><br>
                    He's got mommy issues, a love-hate thing with Miss Pauling (she hates it), and more brothers than bullets in his clip. If that sounds like your brand of chaos, then step up and start sprintin'. The Scout's not waiting around.

                <img src="/character_profile_page_assets/battle_ready_sniper.png" alt="Sniper Battle Ready">
                <p>
                    Crikey. Here's Sniper: the quiet, polite, professional head-remover from down under. He doesn't do drama. He doesn't do speeches. He does do 300-meter headshots that make enemies drop faster than a kangaroo in a wind tunnel.
                    <br><br>
                    Sniper excels at long-range eliminations and keeping the pressure on from afar. He finds a nice perch, lines up the shot, and click—problem solved. He's your go-to guy for thinning enemy numbers and ruining Medics' days.
                    <br><br>
                    Don't expect him on the front lines unless he's holding a jar of questionable yellow liquid. Yes, it's what you think it is. Yes, he'll throw it at you. Don't ask questions.
                    <br><br>
                    He lives in a camper van, drinks questionable coffee, and probably hasn't seen a dentist in years. But when it comes to precision and cool-headed kills, nobody beats the Sniper. If you like being patient, calm, and extremely lethal, the Sniper's waiting for you—with crosshairs locked.

                    Strap on your rocket boots (or just some severely unsafe combat gear) and meet the Soldier: a freedom-fueled, helmet-wearing whirlwind of American patriotism… for whatever country he thinks he's in. He's got a rocket launcher, a dream, and absolutely zero grasp of geography or reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Soldier doesn't walk—he rocket jumps. Why use stairs when you can launch yourself skyward and land with the force of a patriotic meteor? His tactics are loud, explosive, and generally unapproved by any military in the world. But hey, they work.
                    <br><br>
                    Perfect for players who like going high, hitting hard, and shouting “MAGGOTS!” with full-body commitment. Soldier thrives on controlled chaos and aggressive flanking, with bonus points for blowing yourself up in the process.
                    <br><br>
                    His best friend is a shovel, his worst enemy is “strategy,” and his favorite holiday is war. If you believe in winning through sheer yelling and firepower, then congratulations—your boot camp starts now.

                    Spy can cloak, disguise as enemies, and deliver backstabs that instantly end a career. He's also the natural predator of the Engineer—nothing says "oops" like watching your level 3 sentry explode from a single well-timed sapper.
                    <br><br>
                    He's French, smug, and oozes class—usually while puffing a cigarette and checking his watch. He talks like a Bond villain and acts like one too, if Bond also backstabbed five people before breakfast.
                    <br><br>
                    Spy rewards brains, timing, and the ability to vanish like a magician after committing mass sabotage. If you love mind games and making the enemy team scream "SPYYYY!" every five seconds, then the shadows are calling.
                    <br><br>
                    Just remember—trust no one. Not even your teammates. Especially if they're holding a knife and saying "bonjour."
