            Greetings, random internet traveler! Welcome to my humble and barely funcional
            fan page dedicated to Team Fortress 2. This is a personal project in HTML, created just to train my
            skills in web development. Also, it involves a tribute to a popular game
            developed by Valve. Despite the purely educational purpose, I hope you
            enjoy the content and maybe try the game. It's free on Steam!
        </p>

            What is Team Fortress 2?
        </h2>

        <p>
            TF2 is, as said above, a multiplayer first-person shooter game developed by Valve. It started as a sequence
            to a mod for Quake, which was released in 1996. This game is a bit old, being first released back in 2007.
            (Despite its age, my potato computer still can't run it, but that's a different story). TF2 is as chaotic as this page's 
            HTML and CSS code, but still a lot of fun. It is a team-based game with 9 available characters to choose from. 
            So the good news is that if you suck at fps games (like me), you can rely on your team's experienced players to carry you,
            or you can all just accept your fates and let the enemy kick your asses. The game is a lot of fun, and the characters are 
            all unique and funny in their own way.<br><br>
            
            This is considered the father of hero shoters. You like a game where you can play with different characters?
            It probably got some inspiration from TF2. Other games like Overwatch, Paladins, Apex Legends and even LOL drank from the
            same source. As we all know, with great success comes great monetiza... Hphm... I mean, great memes and a great community.
            As expected, it happened to TF2 as well. The comminuty started to create custom maps, skins and mods, sometimes using the
            GMOD engine to bring into existance mostrous aberrations like these ones:

        <p>
            Nightmare fuel, right? But that's not all. There are also videos and even comics that create a whole world
            separate from the game. With characters as unique and charismatic as the ones in TF2, it was expected that
            the game would have such great popularity. True, it suffered a lot of ups and downs due to some problems involving
            a certain company that shall not be named but could easily stop the 'leakage' of bots and hackers in the game, but it returned 
            to its former glory after a while. Anyway, I've talked too much already. Why don't you go ahead and check the characters'
            profiles? You can find them in the link above. I hope you enjoy it!<br><br>
